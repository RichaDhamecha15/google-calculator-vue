### documentation on the solution:

- This application is replica of google calculator, with same design. Working operations on this application are `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` and `., +, =, x (multiply), รท (divide), AC`. CSS is written in same vue file to have scoped css. There is one object for showing keys divided basically in 2 tables, scientificKeys and digitalKeys. The calcutation string is created and passed to evaluate method from mathjs library which gives the result.

### how long did you spend creating the application:

- Spent 6 hours (Approx 5 hours in coding and 1 hour in documenting)

### any assumptions made:

- None

### any queries that need resolving:

- None

### what part of the application are you most proud of:

- The look and feel is much similar to google-calculator, so its almost a pixel perfect design.

### any improvements you would make:

- I would have made it responsive.
- I would have created functionality for remaining buttons.
- I would have written logic myself for the calculations instead of using the library mathjs.

### any deviation(s) from the requirements:

- None
